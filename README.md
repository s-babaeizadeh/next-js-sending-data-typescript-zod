# **Next.js 15 Data Transmission Repository**

## *Overview*
This repository demonstrates four distinct methods for sending data from a Next.js 15 application to a server. Each method is tailored to specific use cases, allowing developers to choose the best approach based on their application needs.

### *Methods Covered*
Sending a JSON Payload to an API Endpoint
This method is suitable for applications that require structured data transfer, such as when interacting with RESTful APIs.
Sending a Form Data Payload to an API Endpoint
Ideal for traditional form submissions where data is sent in a format that can be easily processed by the server.
Sending a Data Object to a Server Action
This approach leverages Next.js's server actions, allowing for more direct and efficient data handling within the application.
Sending a Form Data Object to Another Server Action
Similar to the previous method but specifically designed for form submissions that need to trigger server-side logic.

### *Technologies Used*
Next.js 15: The latest version of the React framework for building server-rendered applications.
Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code reliability.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Shadcn: A component library designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.
